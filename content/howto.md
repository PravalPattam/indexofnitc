# How To Contribute

The Projects aims to be a completely community driven initiative that will move according to the demand and usage of the community. The Source code of the project is available [Here](https://github.com/tellmeY18/indexofnitc) and is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The indexes are categorised and are added to markdown files with suitable names. They are located inside the 'posts' directory which is inside the 'content' directory.
